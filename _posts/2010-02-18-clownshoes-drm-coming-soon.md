Can you believe this [horse shit](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/02/17/you-maniacs/)?  Yes, you read correctly.  DRM that requires you to be online.  At all times.  Not at all irritating.  Check the calendar, folks &#8212; it&#8217;s not the first of April.

I&#8217;ve already had enough of the likes of Securom messing up my (paid for) games.  My trials and tribulations included misfiring versions of Fallout 3 (randomly stopped working and required a reboot) and Race Driver: GRID (I had to eject the disc prior to starting the game every single time).

Unfortunately, Ubisoft&#8217;s latest &#8216;solution&#8217; looks far more invasive.  Do these companies honestly believe that penalising their paying customers will lead to improved sales?  It&#8217;s a guaranteed road to ruin.  There&#8217;ll likely be a cracked (read: superior) version on torrent sites within the week of release &#8212; possibly a day zero effort.  I don&#8217;t advocate game piracy, but I could swear that certain game publishers do.

Along similar lines: I&#8217;m already fed up with the amount of games that require extra bullshit.  Every single extra step that I have to take is a barrier between me and your game.  Recently, many games are starting to demand a Windows Live account, even when I don&#8217;t care about it.  Batman was bad enough for it, but GTA IV on the PC requires me to sign up for a Windows Live account **and** then constantly nags me to sign up for the Rockstar Social Club.  This adds an extra two screens to click through every goddamn time I want to launch the game.  I don&#8217;t want to watch some user generated bollocks video about a clown on a moped, I just want to play the game.

I feel like William Shatner in [&#8220;I can&#8217;t get behind that&#8221;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6pYG1DQ4s).  Leave me the hell alone!

Here&#8217;s the old way of playing a game you&#8217;ve recently purchased:

  1. Install
  2. Click on shortcut to launch game

Sounds pretty good to me.
