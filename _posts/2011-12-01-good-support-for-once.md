… kinda.&#160; I recently built a new computer and one of the parts I received was faulty.&#160; The heatsink bracket had a missing thread, so it was impossible to screw the brackets together.

I emailed [Novatech](http://www.novatech.co.uk/) support, assuming I was in for the full, painful returns rigmarole, but was pleasantly surprised, but also befuddled at the hoop jumping I had to do.&#160; 

# The good

I described the problem and told them exactly which bracket was unusable (the [Zalman CNPS 10X Quiet](http://www.guru3d.com/article/zalman-cnps-10x-quiet-and-extreme-review/) comes with three mounting brackets for different motherboard types, and only the LGA 1155 bracket was faulty).&#160; I only had to wait to speak on the phone for about 30 seconds of hold music the second time I phoned.&#160; 

Most importantly, I received a new bracket in the post the next day, and you can’t say that about most places.

# The bad

This is where I get somewhat bemused.&#160; Despite the excellent eventual result, their website and returns process is set up to bewilder.&#160; Numerous small, niggly problems occurred.&#160; Bear in mind my needs as a customer; nothing I wanted to do was outside the ordinary.&#160; The reason I am posting this is not to take a pop at Novatech.&#160; It’s more that this sort of stuff is common with many of the companies I’ve bought from in the past.&#160; It surely can’t be this hard to get right?

  1. No website ticket was maintained, as by sending me a replacement part, the support request was quickly “rejected” so that it was clear I didn’t have to send anything back.&#160; Fine, but… 
  2. As a result, I didn’t have a coherent trail of communication, as I was living outside the happy path.&#160; Some of the exchanges were done via the website, the next via email and the last part by phone.&#160; I always like to double check I’ve given people all of the correct information and also keep up with the status of my request, but I could not do this. 
  3. They asked me to phone up to make sure I gave them the correct delivery address.&#160; Why can I do part of the process online, but not another part?&#160; The part I was asked to phone about was most suitable for a 2 minute email.&#160; Instead, I had to phone up twice (the first time I was put on hold, and wasn’t willing to waste 10 minutes of my lunchtime sighing).&#160; 
  4. The member of support staff could not pull up my delivery details or even send it to the same place as my original order.&#160; “I don’t have that information”.&#160; Reading an address over the phone is just asking for it to be taken down incorrectly (which it was – thankfully it was still good enough to get through). 
  5. Since the member of support staff hadn’t read my email notes / support thread, they tried to tell me that they were going to send a courier to pick up the package.&#160; I had to re-explain that Novatech were _sending me a bracket_.&#160; It was not an RMA request. 
  6. When I tried to reply to my support email (which it explicitly says you can in the body of the support email reply) with my delivery address, the email bounced.&#160; At least Novatech allegedly allow you to email back; I assume it was a glitch.&#160; 
    **Aside**: I hate it when sites contact me via one communication medium but force me to reply in a roundabout way.&#160; Seriously, companies.&#160; Balls to “noreply” email addresses – even if you have no automated process for tying up threads of communication, just divert the emails to customer support representatives and let them marry up the information manually.&#160; It should be as easy as possible for the customer, and the information should be maintained in a coherent, chronological thread for both employees and customers to browse. </li> 
    
      * The reference number in the returns email title / body was no use.&#160; The woman on the other end asked, “Don’t you have one that starts with an R?”&#160; If the returns number in the email is not the correct one I have to quote, why are you sending it to me?&#160; Odd! 
      * When I received the replacement part, it was in a box for a 2.5” drive enclosure.&#160; I’m fine with that normally, use any box you like!&#160; However, it had taped edges that read “**DO NOT OPEN IF PARTS ARE INCORRECT**”.&#160; How can I tell the parts are incorrect if it’s in a different box?&#160; I opened it anyway.</ol> 
    
    # Ultimately…
    
    For a relatively simple request, I encountered several problems / inconveniences.&#160; The bottom line is that despite the eventual good result, I am a touch wary of using Novatech again for anything more complicated / expensive.&#160; If a PC part failed on a built system, I wouldn’t fancy being passed around their support system and having to constantly re-explain myself.
    
    Moreover, I never fail to be astounded by these sorts of interactions I have with companies.&#160; It would drive me mad to live with that kind of chaos on a day to day basis.
    
    The positive thing is that at least, despite the problems I had, Novatech obviously do care about sorting out customer problems.&#160; I didn’t have to send anything back and do a full RMA cycle, and the parts reached me very quickly.&#160; If they could iron out some of these niggles, they’d be highly recommendable.
