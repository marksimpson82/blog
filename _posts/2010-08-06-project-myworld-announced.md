We finally announced our [minature-version-of-real-world-as-a-platform-for-games project](http://playmyworld.com) last week.  Image shamelessly nicked from [Luke&#8217;s blog](http://lukehalliwell.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/project-myworld/):

I&#8217;ve worked on this for over 2 and a half years (in test engineering and software engineering capacities) and learned a hell of a lot during that period.  It&#8217;s not finished yet, but [head on over and check it out](http://playmyworld.com/) :D
