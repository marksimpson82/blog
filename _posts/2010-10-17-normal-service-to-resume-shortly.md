I've had an ... interesting few months.

Realtime Worlds went into administration and then collapsed. It was quite abrupt; abrupt to the point where even the more cynical amongst us (i.e. me) didn't see it coming. We'd done some cursory back-of-the-fag-packet calculations in the pub and reckoned there was roughly another year of funding in place; we'd also been assured in the past that MyWorld was not at the mercy of APB's performance.

The gist of it is that APB launched to a critical mauling. The company's great hope haemorrhaged money; the sack-everybody card was duly played. Understandably, the project that was not making revenue was first on the chopping block and MyWorld staff were placed on 30 days of consultation, with a further 30 days of notice of dismissal after that. It was a long, drawn-out process that bore little fruit. Needless to say, I was very, very ... displeased. More than two and a half years of service down the drain; some folk had much more to lose.

Long story short, we all got made redundant. During this period I was rather pre-ocuppied and didn't do much interesting programming at home (I spent most of the time in the pub moping and fostering a weird, giddy doom-mongering spirit), so the blog went a touch quiet.

A new company sprang up to continue development of MyWorld and I'm now a part of it. This is now common knowledge, so there's no great harm in saying so. Hopefully we (we as in : the new company) will be blogging about our games/technology/company culture in future, but I'll try to resume normal service of talking balls here, too. I've recharged my batteries and I'm ready to go again :)

On another plus note, pretty much every single person I knew on MyWorld has now secured a new job.
