I&#8217;ve had an .. interesting few months.

Realtime Worlds went into administration and then collapsed.  It was quite abrupt; abrupt to the point where even the more cynical amongst us (i.e. me) didn&#8217;t see it coming.  We&#8217;d done some cursory back-of-the-fag-packet calculations in the pub and reckoned there was roughly another year of funding in place; we&#8217;d also been assured in the past that MyWorld was not at the mercy of APB&#8217;s performance.

The gist of it is that APB launched to a critical mauling.  The company&#8217;s great hope haemorrhaged money; the sack-everybody card was duly played.  Understandably, the project that was not making revenue was first on the chopping block and MyWorld staff were placed on 30 days of consultation, with a further 30 days of notice of dismissal after that.  It was a long, drawn-out process that bore little fruit.  Needless to say, I was very, very &#8230; displeased.  More than two and a half years of service down the drain; some folk had much more to lose.

Long story short, we all got made redundant.  During this period I was rather pre-ocuppied and didn&#8217;t do much interesting programming at home (I spent most of the time in the pub moping and fostering a weird, giddy doom-mongering spirit), so the blog went a touch quiet.

A new company sprang up to continue development of MyWorld and I&#8217;m now a part of it.  This is now common knowledge, so there&#8217;s no great harm in saying so.  Hopefully we (we as in : the new company) will be blogging about our games/technology/company culture in future, but I&#8217;ll try to resume normal service of talking balls here, too.  I&#8217;ve recharged my batteries and I&#8217;m ready to go again :)

On another plus note, pretty much every single person I knew on MyWorld has now secured a new job.
