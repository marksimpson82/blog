Python has the terribly useful functionality of [bin()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#bin) to do this, but what about C#?

On the rare occasion I have to monkey around with bitwise operators, I always keep this handy. It has the added bonus of printing the leading zeros â€“ I find this very useful when writing/debugging bitwise code, as it makes it easy to line up bitmasks etc. in the immediate window / console.

> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; return Convert.ToString(_long, 2).PadLeft(sizeof(long) * 8, &#8216;0&#8217;);&#160;  
> &#160;&#160;&#160; }

Similarly, you could write a few of these (for all of the various inbuilt types) and chuck them in extension methods.
