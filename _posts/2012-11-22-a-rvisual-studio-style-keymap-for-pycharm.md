PyCharm is a lovely little IDE for Python by the splendid JetBrains, but the built-in Visual Studio keymap is not much like the default VS/R# settings I’m accustomed to. I’ve rustled up a quick version that restores all of the easy to remember refactoring key combinations (Ctrl-Shift-R, Ctrl-R, Action Key etc.) along with some of the common navigation ones (Ctrl, comma for recent files and so forth).

There’s a few things missing and I’ve unbound some of the PyCharm functionality as it clashed with the R# style keymap, so your mileage may vary. Give it a try, though!
