... to make aspects of your game totally totally and utterly unbalanced when new players are in the mix? I realise that people are OCD and like collecting shit, but has it _really_ come to this? 

I say this because I’ve finally had the time / hardware upgrade to allow me to play BF3, and what do I find? Every bugger has guns and vehicle perks except me. In some cases this is not so bad (e.g. I can do just fine without heavy barrel and minor _options_ like that) but in other cases it renders the game unplayable for the noobs. E.g. I get in a chopper and get shot down instantly, as I don’t have any countermeasures. The best I can do is wait for a friend to come online who already has chopper perks so I can piggy back off them. 

Similarly, folk in jets have perks like air radar so they can find me easily. Tankers get various perks like coax machine gun & smoke. 

In my opinion, everyone should start with the key class/vehicle items (defibs, flares etc.) and anything beyond that should be a sideways option. By sideways, I mean that you already have a default set of perks/tech (such as smoke in the tank), and additional perks give you _options_ for certain situations, not concrete _advantages_. As far as I’m aware, there’s no disadvantage to having flares (as opposed to nothing). 

I don’t get it. It’s just as ... weird as starting with no defibs in BC2 – you couldn’t actually be a medic until you’d played for a while. Games are naturally weighted in favour of experienced players, as they have map / weapon / game knowledge that new players lack. By design, this compounds matters.
