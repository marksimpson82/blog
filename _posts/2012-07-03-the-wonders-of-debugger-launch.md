Ever worked on a project that involved spawning new .NET processes? (as in, one [arbitrary] program launches another .NET executable) I’ve had to do this on quite a few occasions over the years and the one thing that always saves my bacon when it comes to understanding and fixing bugs is [Debugger.Launch()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debugger.launch.aspx).

A common scenario is as follows:

* Program / Script A is launched
* Program / Script A makes a call to launch .NET Program B (e.g. via [`Process.Start()`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.start.aspx))
* .NET Program B throws an exception and it’s not immediately clear why.
* The world ends. 

If you’re the author of program B, simply insert a call to `Debugger.Launch()` inside `Main()`. The program will halt execution and prompt you to attach the debugger. You can then examine the conditions and fix the bug. 

Also, another thing to try is to create a handler that wraps the program’s invocation in a `try`/`catch` block, complete with an `#if` wrapped call to `Debugger.Launch()`. This allows you to connect to the crashing process without requiring lots of boilerplate code.

I wouldn't recommend using this for production code in case you forget to remove it (add conditional `#if``guards and whatnot), but it’s nice to have in the toolbag nonetheless.

E.g.

```c#
public static class AttachableRunner  
{  
  public static void RunWithDebugger(Action _action)  
  {  
    try  
    {   
      _action();  
    }  
    catch(Exception e)  
    {  
      Debugger.Launch();  
      throw;  
    }  
  }  
}
```

This does just fine for debugging most problems. 

**Note**: It won’t attach properly if your program causes an unhandled exception to be thrown on a a thread other than the main thread. I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader (\*cough\* [AppDomain.UnhandledException](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.unhandledexception.aspx) can help, but won’t give you as much useful information beyond standard callstack info).
