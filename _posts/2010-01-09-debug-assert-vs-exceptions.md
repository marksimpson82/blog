    "When should I use Debug.Assert and when should I use exceptions?" - It's a fairly sensible question to ask, but you've got to sift through a lot of articles to get anything resembling solid guidance on it (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467568/debug-assert-vs-exception-throwing/1468385#1468385">Eric Lippert's stack overflow post is particularly enlightening</a>). I've wrestled with it quite a bit as a programmer and test engineer, so here's my 2 pence.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Good rules of thumb I've arrived at:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Asserts are not a replacement for robust code that functions correctly independent of configuration. They are complementary debugging aids.
    </li>
    <li>
      Asserts should never be tripped during a unit test run, even when feeding in invalid values or testing error conditions. The code should anticipate and handle these conditions without an assert occurring!
    </li>
    <li>
      If an assert trips (either in a unit test or during normal application usage), the class containing the assert is the prime suspect, as it has somehow managed to get into an invalid state (i.e. it's bugged).
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    For all other errors - typically down to environment (network connection lost) or misuse (caller passed a null value) - it's much nicer and more understandable to use hard checks & exceptions. If an exception occurs, the caller knows it's likely their fault. This is what makes the .NET base class libraries a joy to develop with - it usually clear when you are misusing an API, resulting in fewer <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips">"select is broken"</a> moments. It fails early and clearly communicates the reason for failure.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should be able to test and use your class with erroneous input, bad state, invalid order of operations and any other conceivable error condition and an assert should <strong>never</strong> trip expectedly. Each assert is checking something should <strong>always</strong> be true regardless of the inputs or computations performed. If something should always be true, then the number of asserts used shouldn't be a barrier to thorough unit testing. If an assert occurs, the caller knows it's likely a bug in the code where the assert is located.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you stick to this level of separation, things are a bit easier.
