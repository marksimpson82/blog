## Q: How do you take notes? A: Privately.
As a follow-on from [How do you take notes?]({% post_url 2022-10-30-obsidian %}), I thought I'd write a (very) short update.

tl;dr: I've been using Obsidian for my personal note-taking since 2022, and I really like it.
- I have a private git repository
- I write my notes in markdown (just like this blog)
- I don't have to care about whether the subject I'm writing about is boring or suitable for sharing (like this!)
- I am free to mix plain text with code snippets, or reference (small) files, whatever
  - This is especially useful for things I've partly automated and use infrequently
- I can come back to things I'd often forget, e.g. boiler part numbers / instructions

## Downsides
The downside is that it's temporarily killed this blog. 

It may look like I'm in a coma, but I am still furiously writing. The posts are not shared, though. When I have to tackle a subject, I tend to just write my own notes to clarify my own thoughts, e.g. in no particular order:
- Git spells and internals
- Testing microservices
- The boundaries of various testing / faking approaches
  - In process
  - Out of process
  - Using tools like Wireshark
- Learning golang
- Learning AI/LLM fundamentals (I won't subject anyone to this, plenty of awesome resources out there!)

## Public blogging
I've had to fix my public blog a few times because the GitHub action that publishes broke a few times. It's now back up.

I will try and cherry pick a few interesting topics and re-shape a few for my public blog.

Here's a sample of what I've been writing about but not sharing.
```shell

# show the largest by line count in desc. order
