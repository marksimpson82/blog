If you’re still editing your blog using the WordPress (or equivalent) web interface, I’d recommend checking out [Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer?os=other).&#160; I was introduced to it at work, as we maintain an internal technical blog to ensure that our [bus factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is acceptable.&#160; Windows live writer is simple, easy to set up and much more pleasant to work with – I’d thoroughly recommend it.&#160; It’s a free download, too.
