**Note**: this is obviously antiquated and no longer relevant!

If you’re still editing your blog using the WordPress (or equivalent) web interface, I’d recommend checking out 
[Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer?os=other). I was introduced to it at work, as we 
maintain an internal technical blog to ensure that our [bus factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is 
acceptable. Windows live writer is simple, easy to set up and much more pleasant to work with – I’d thoroughly 
recommend it. It’s a free download, too.
