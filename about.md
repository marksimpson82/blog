My name is Mark, and I’m a software engineer. I started out life as a Software Engineer in Test and remain ill to this very day.

My reasons for creating a blog are twofold: Firstly, it’s a good way to disseminate the knowledge I acquire — if I manage to explain something useful, I can simply refer people to the post rather than have to explain it multiple times. Secondly, if I can’t explain it, I don’t understand it. Thirdly, I'm a dullard.
